# 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Free Plan Lead Generation

## The Bug

**Symptom**: New users on FREE plan immediately see "Monthly limit reached" when trying to generate leads, even though they haven't generated any leads yet.

**Root Cause**: The FREE plan configuration had `leadsPerMonth: 0` instead of `-1`, causing the validation logic to immediately block all lead generation attempts.

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN)
FREE: {
  limits: {
    leadsPerMonth: 0,      // <-- THIS WAS THE BUG!
    leadsLifetime: 5,
  },
}

// The canGenerateLeads function checks:
if (monthlyUsed >= leadsPerMonth) {  // 0 >= 0 = TRUE = BLOCKED!
  return "Monthly limit reached"
}
```

## The Fix

Changed FREE plan to have no monthly limit (only lifetime limit):

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (FIXED)
FREE: {
  limits: {
    leadsPerMonth: -1,     // -1 means "no monthly limit"
    leadsLifetime: 5,      // Only lifetime limit applies
  },
}
```

## Files Changed

1. **`/src/config/plans.ts`**
   - Changed `leadsPerMonth: 0` → `leadsPerMonth: -1` for FREE plan
   - This allows FREE users to generate up to 5 total lifetime leads
   - No monthly reset for FREE plan (it's lifetime only)

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```bash
$ npx tsx scripts/test-can-generate.ts
FREE plan, 0 used, 0 lifetime:
  Result: {
    allowed: false,  ❌
    reason: 'Monthly lead limit reached.'
  }
```

### After Fix:
```bash
$ npx tsx scripts/test-can-generate.ts
FREE plan, 0 used, 0 lifetime:
  Result: { allowed: true }  ✅
```

## How It Should Work Now

### FREE Plan (5 Lifetime Leads)
- ✅ Can generate leads until reaching 5 total
- ✅ No monthly limit check
- ✅ Only lifetime limit enforced
- ❌ Blocked after 5 total leads generated

Example flow:
1. New user signs up → 0/5 leads used
2. Generates 2 leads → 2/5 used ✅
3. Generates 3 more → 5/5 used ✅
4. Tries to generate more → Blocked ❌ "Lifetime limit reached"

### PRO Plans (1000/month)
- ✅ Can generate up to 1000 leads per month
- ✅ Counter resets monthly
- ✅ No lifetime limit

## Database Status

All user accounts checked:
```
Org: Personal Account (user_34N6d158wbASFIQGLq2S9TAJmmD)
  Plan: FREE
  Actual Leads: 0
  Credit Usage: 0 used, 0 lifetime ✅

Org: Personal Account (user_34NA7zFk1eqgiZXTKeDifPcEz4M)
  Plan: FREE
  Actual Leads: 0
  Credit Usage: 0 used, 0 lifetime ✅

Org: Personal Account (user_34NAklfDIedjHp1ukH1hysq0ebo)
  Plan: FREE
  Actual Leads: 0
  Credit Usage: 0 used, 0 lifetime ✅
```

**All accounts are clean and ready to generate leads!**

## What To Test

1. **Sign in to your account**
2. **Go to** `/dashboard/leads/generate`
3. **You should now see:**
   - "Free plan: Maximum 5 leads (5 remaining of 5 total lifetime)" ✅
   - Input field allowing 1-5 leads
   - NO "monthly limit reached" error
4. **Generate 1-2 test leads**
5. **Counter should update correctly**
