# Authentication and Pricing Fixes

## Issues Addressed

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve issues with Signup, Signin, and the Pricing page.

## Problems Identified

1. **Missing Sign-in and Sign-up Pages**: The app was using Clerk for authentication, but no actual page components existed for the `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` routes.
2. **Incomplete Pricing Page**: The pricing page was just a placeholder with minimal content and no payment integration.
3. **Missing Payment Integration**: No API routes existed to handle subscription creation and verification.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sign-in Page (`src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`)

Created a dedicated sign-in page that:
- Uses Clerk's `<SignIn>` component
- Provides a clean, centered layout with gradient background
- Includes proper routing configuration
- Shows a welcoming message to returning users
- Properly styled to match the app's design system

### 2. Sign-up Page (`src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`)

Created a dedicated sign-up page that:
- Uses Clerk's `<SignUp>` component
- Provides a clean, centered layout with gradient background
- Includes proper routing configuration
- Shows an encouraging message for new users
- Properly styled to match the app's design system

### 3. Enhanced Pricing Page (`src/app/pricing/page.tsx`)

Completely rewrote the pricing page with:
- **Client-side interactivity**: Made it a client component with state management
- **Four plan tiers**: Free, Pro Monthly, Pro Yearly, and Enterprise
- **Authentication integration**: Uses Clerk's `useAuth()` hook to check if user is signed in
- **Payment gateway integration**: Integrates with Razorpay for subscription payments
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Visual enhancements**: Popular badge, proper card layout, feature lists
- **Smart CTAs**: Different actions based on plan type and auth status:
  - Free plan → Navigate to dashboard (if signed in) or sign-up
  - Enterprise → Email contact form
  - Pro plans → Payment gateway (if signed in) or sign-up redirect

### 4. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)

Extended the `Subscription` model to support Razorpay:
```prisma
- Added `razorpaySubscriptionId` field (unique, indexed)
- Added `razorpayPaymentId` field
- Added `currentPeriodStart` field
- Added `PENDING` status to SubscriptionStatus enum
```

### 5. API Route: Create Subscription (`src/app/api/create-subscription/route.ts`)

Created a new API route that:
- Validates user authentication via Clerk
- Validates plan selection
- Creates or retrieves organization record
- Creates a Razorpay subscription
- Stores subscription details in the database with PENDING status
- Returns subscription ID for the checkout flow

### 6. API Route: Verify Subscription (`src/app/api/verify-subscription/route.ts`)

Created a new API route that:
- Validates user authentication
- Verifies Razorpay payment signature for security
- Updates subscription status to ACTIVE
- Sets subscription period dates
- Creates audit log entry for tracking
- Returns success confirmation

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your `.env` file:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/dashboard"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/dashboard"

# Razorpay Payment Gateway
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID="rzp_test_..."
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_RZP_PLAN_PRO_MONTHLY="plan_..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_RZP_PLAN_PRO_YEARLY="plan_..."
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Sign-up Flow**: Navigate to `/sign-up` and create a new account
- [ ] **Sign-in Flow**: Navigate to `/sign-in` and log in with existing credentials
- [ ] **Pricing Page**: Visit `/pricing` to see all plans
- [ ] **Free Plan Selection**: Click "Get Started" on Free plan (should redirect appropriately)
- [ ] **Pro Plan Selection** (when signed out): Click "Start Trial" (should redirect to sign-up)
- [ ] **Pro Plan Selection** (when signed in): Click "Start Trial" (should open Razorpay checkout)
- [ ] **Payment Completion**: Complete a test payment with Razorpay test credentials
- [ ] **Subscription Activation**: Verify subscription status updates to ACTIVE in database
- [ ] **Dashboard Access**: Confirm dashboard shows correct plan after subscription

## Database Migration

To apply the schema changes to your database:

```bash
# Push schema changes to database
pnpm prisma db push

# Or create a migration
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add_razorpay_fields

# Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm prisma generate
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Signature Verification**: All Razorpay webhooks and payments are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures
2. **Authentication Required**: All payment operations require valid Clerk authentication
3. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive keys are stored in environment variables, never in code
4. **Database Constraints**: Proper unique constraints on subscription IDs prevent duplicate charges

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Mode Only**: Currently configured for Razorpay test mode
2. **Basic Error Handling**: Could be enhanced with retry logic and better error messages
3. **Email Notifications**: No automated email confirmations yet (could be added)
4. **Subscription Management**: No cancel/upgrade flow UI yet (planned)

## Next Steps

1. Set up Razorpay webhook handler for subscription events
2. Add subscription management page in dashboard
3. Implement plan upgrade/downgrade flows
4. Add automated email notifications
5. Set up production Razorpay credentials
6. Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring
